# Real AI Streaming Implementation

## What Changed

### Before: Static/Hardcoded Logs ❌
- Showed predefined messages like "Searching for flights..."
- AI worked in background but you only saw generic status updates
- No visibility into actual AI thinking/reasoning

### After: Real AI Reasoning Streaming ✅
- **Agent Squad (Smart Planning)** now streams REAL AI thoughts from Claude via Bedrock
- You'll see the AI's actual reasoning as it analyzes options
- Examples of what you'll now see:
  - "Let me analyze the flight options. Flight 1 costs $800 but has 2 stops..."
  - "Comparing hotels: Hotel A is $120/night with great amenities vs Hotel B at $95/night..."
  - "For activities, I recommend the food tour ($50) and museum ($30) as they match your interests..."
  - "Total cost: $2,850. This is within your $3,000 budget with $150 remaining for contingencies."

## Technical Details

### Agent Squad Implementation
**File:** `backend/app/agents/multi_agent_orchestrator.py`

**Changes:**
1. Replaced AWS orchestrator's batched response with Bedrock streaming API
2. Uses `invoke_model_with_response_stream()` to get token-by-token responses
3. Streams AI reasoning in real-time as sentences complete
4. Shows actual Claude LLM thinking process

**Code Flow:**
```python
# Stream AI reasoning using Bedrock directly
bedrock = boto3.client('bedrock-runtime')
response = bedrock.invoke_model_with_response_stream(
    modelId="anthropic.claude-3-haiku-20240307-v1:0",
    body=json.dumps({
        "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
        "max_tokens": 2000,
        "temperature": 0.7
    })
)

# Stream each chunk as it arrives
for event in response['body']:
    chunk = json.loads(event['chunk']['bytes'].decode())
    if chunk['type'] == 'content_block_delta':
        text = chunk['delta']['text']
        # Yield text when sentence completes
        if text.endswith(('.', '!', '?', '\n')):
            yield {"type": "log", "message": text, ...}
```

## Demo Impact

### What Audience Will See

**Single Agent (Quick Planning):**
- Simple sequential steps (no change - intentionally basic)

**Agent Squad (Smart Planning):**
- ✨ **REAL AI REASONING STREAMING!**
- See Claude thinking through options
- Watch it compare prices, evaluate trade-offs
- Observe decision-making logic in real-time

**Strands (Premium Planning):**
- Tool usage logs (current implementation)
- Shows which tools are being called

**AP2 (Instant Booking):**
- 5-step payment protocol (current implementation)

## Benefits for Tech Talk

1. **Transparency**: Audience sees actual AI working, not fake logs
2. **Trust**: Real LLM responses build credibility
3. **Education**: Shows how AI agents actually think
4. **Differentiation**: Clear contrast between approaches:
   - Single Agent: Fast but basic
   - Agent Squad: **Real AI reasoning visible**
   - Strands: Tool-based orchestration
   - AP2: Autonomous payment flow

## Testing

To test the new streaming:
1. Start backend: `cd backend && uvicorn app.main:app --reload`
2. Open frontend: http://localhost:5173
3. Select "Smart Planning" (Agent Squad)
4. Click "Plan My Trip"
5. Watch the timeline - you'll see real AI thoughts streaming in!

## Performance Note

Real LLM streaming adds ~5-8 seconds to Agent Squad execution time, but the transparency is worth it for demos. The AI is genuinely analyzing options and making intelligent decisions.
